                    <h3>Welcome to November, one of the sexiest times of the year.</h3>
                    <p> Scorpio season invites us to dive into our fantasies, kinks, and obsessions. Action-oriented Mars spends the entire month in Scorpio, so notice when you are feeling possessive or paranoid as these feelings are showing you the shadow side of Scorpio energy. Redirect the intensity by channeling that focus into what you are passionate about while romantic Venus moves from feisty Sagittarius into stoic Capricorn on the 6th, bringing a more serious tone to relationships and intimacy. This isn’t a bad thing, as 2021 is winding down, use the time to take stock and find clarity around what you want from your partnerships and your sex life. November will be interesting, it rests between the last Mercury retrograde of the year which affected us throughout October, and Venus, taking its retrograde turn next month. Relationships that were up for review last month can move forward with less pressure, especially as we move into the holidays. When the Sun moves into truth seeker Sagittarius on the 22nd, watch out for taking jokesˇæ too far as people are still very sensitive with Mars in Scorpio. Remember everyone is reading into every word spoken and keeping receipts. In short, this month focus on the healing power of sex by surrendering to your inner desires, releasing shame, and leaning in to vulnerability as it is where transformation and connection await you.</p>

                    <h3>Scorpio & is Rising</h3>
                    <p>Happy solar return Scorpio! You’ve been waiting patiently for the most magical time of year, where everyone wishes they were a Scorpio, (or could at least be with one!) You are the master of allowing people to see only what you allow them to, preferring to control your relationships and interactions. This isn’t wicked, it’s a safety precaution. Imagine if you offered your partners the same transparency and vulnerability you require of them? It’s only scary because to lay yourself bare is equivalent to death for you. Dramatic yes, but that ego death is the door to the ultimate connective intimacy.</p>

                    <h3>Leo & Leo Rising</h3>
                    <p>Make your home your sexy sanctuary this month, Leo. You may be feeling less social for a few weeks and need a little extra quiet time. Rather than getting stuck in your head obsessing over things beyond your control, take advantage of the reprieve from your busy social calendar and add some cozy touches to your pad, such as soft blankets and candles. Set the mood for romantic date nights in, order delicious takeout and queue up your favorite films. Since it’s Scorpio season, opt for erotic thrillers and cuddle up on the couch – clothing optional.</p>
